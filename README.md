## LaunchDarkly DevRel Team Demo 

This application is a frontend built in ReactJS with a Python API tier built in. This demo has had design input on the visuals to optimize the look and feel of the page, and has a integrated API to allow for backend feature flag demonstrations as well. 

The database demo requires a connection to DynamoDB in AWS so ensure that you have created that, associated IAM roles, and modified the code as needed.
